# Destill

From Destill (analysis) by Brianna Bass (Mineral House Media) 

Yoella Razili’s work taps into a similar questioning of familiar forms, channeling figurative essences without allowing the form to be recognized. In its color and softness, thickness and heaviness, the work activates urgency in the viewer to comprehend what is at the edge of recognition. “In my work, I try to reach a balance of forces. I aim to get a resolution of tension between contradicting surfaces, weights, scale, and color [...] It is tangible, perhaps recognizable and affirming, but yet new, pure, and magical.[6]”
